COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge(Kaggle)

Exploring coronavirus research papers

This repository does not participate in the challenge however, it is a personal attempt to the Open research dataset challenge.

## Currently tackling: Task 1.
Task one involves finding range of incubation periods for the disease in humans(and how it varies across age and health status) and how long individuals are contagious even after recovery.
Link to tasks can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=568

### Goal.
Using toolkits such as nltk for python and probable machine learning techniques, attempt to visualise incubation periods of the disease and age variations using a graph.

### Roadmap.
1) Understanding data structures to use.(Complete)
2) Data cleaning.(Currently working on this...)
3) Research on python toolkits etc.
